Takion is C++17 template based implementation of deep learning. It is suitable for deep learning on limited computational resource, embedded systems and IoT devices. The code can be compiled with commonly available compilers such as g++, clang++, or Microsoft Visual Studio. Takion currently supports macOS (10.12.6 or later), Ubuntu (18.04 or later), Windows (Visual Studio 2017 or later), and Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL). Other untested platforms that support C++17 also should be able to build Takion.

## Key Features

- Reasonably fast, without GPU
- Portable & header-only
- Easy to integrate with real applications
- Simply implemented
